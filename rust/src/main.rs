/**
 * EVM From Scratch
 * Rust template
 *
 * To work on EVM From Scratch in Rust:
 *
 * - Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
 * - Edit `rust/lib.rs`
 * - Run `cd rust && cargo run` to run the tests
 *
 * Hint: most people who were trying to learn Rust and EVM at the same
 * gave up and switched to JavaScript, Python, or Go. If you are new
 * to Rust, implement EVM in another programming language first.

 // if we initialise a project in rust using cargo new projectname but then chnage the name of the project from outside without chnaging the name in the package section of cargo.toml then it will not cause  problem, here the cargo was initialsed using evm package name but then it was changed to rust 
 //here evm is refering to ur package name only 
 //when we create a new package here evm then the files lib.rs and main.rs are named actually after the package name, so to use some function of library crate we have to write this statement of use evm::evm, as evm is the package name so lib.rs name is also evm, the func name is also evm
